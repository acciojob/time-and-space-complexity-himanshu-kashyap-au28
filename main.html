	<h1>Time,Space,Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is efficienta type of a computational complexity that describes the time required to execute an algorithm. The time complexity of an algorithm is the amount of time it takes for each statement to complete. As a result, it is highly dependent on the size of the processed data.</p>
	<p>The <b>space complexity</b> of an algorithm or a data structure is the amount of memory space required to solve an instance of the computational problem as a function of characteristics of the input. It is the memory required by an algorithm until it executes completely.O(n)</p>
